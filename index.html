			“Where do ideas come from? From looking at one thing, and seeing another.
			From fooling around, from playing with possibilities, from speculating,
			from changing, pushing, pulling, transforming, and if you’re lucky,
			you come up with something worth saving, using, 
			and building on. That’s where the game stops and the work begins.”
